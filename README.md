# Copper

<img src="assets/copper_icon_48.png"/>

**Copper** is a web application built in Flutter that helps engineers analyze and improve their KiCad PCB designs. By parsing PCB design files, the application extracts key design information and uses Azure AI Services to provide insights, detect errors, and suggest optimizations.

## Features
- üìÅ **Upload and Parse KiCad PCB Files** ‚Äì Extracts design details from PCB design files (currently .kicad_pcb) files.
- üîç **Trace & Routing Analysis** ‚Äì Evaluates trace widths, clearance, and routing efficiency.
- ‚ö° **Power & Signal Integrity Insights** ‚Äì Detects potential issues in power distribution and signal paths.
- üìä **Manufacturability Review** ‚Äì Ensures the PCB design meets fabrication constraints.
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Feedback** ‚Äì Uses Azure AI Services for advanced analysis and recommendations.
- üìÑ **Detailed Reports** ‚Äì Generates structured feedback for engineers to refine their designs.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend:
- **Flutter Web** ‚Äì Provides a responsive UI for analyzing PCB designs.
- **Dart** ‚Äì Powers the application logic and interactions.

### Backend & AI Services:
- **Azure AI Services** ‚Äì Performs AI-driven analysis on PCB design data.
- **Azure Functions** ‚Äì Handles backend processing for file parsing and AI requests.
- **Azure Blob Storage** ‚Äì Stores uploaded .kicad_pcb files and processed reports.

## Project Workflow

1Ô∏è‚É£ **User Uploads a KiCad PCB File**
The user selects a PCB design file (`.kicad_pcb`) file and uploads it to the application.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Parsing the PCB File**
The application extracts key data from the file, including:

- Components & Footprints
- Traces, Vias & Copper Zones
- Netlists & Layer Information
- Design Rules & Constraints

This parsed data is stored in an internal representation that allows for structured analysis.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **AI-Powered Analysis with Azure AI Services**
Once the design data is structured, the application sends relevant information to Azure AI Services for further analysis. These services provide:

‚úÖ Design Rule & Electrical Rule Compliance
- Identifies DRC & ERC violations using AI-assisted pattern recognition.
- Suggests potential fixes based on best practices.

‚úÖ Trace & Routing Evaluation
- Detects bottlenecks, excessive via use, or unnecessary trace complexity.
- Provides insights into trace width adequacy for expected current loads.

‚úÖ Power & Signal Integrity Analysis
- Checks ground planes, power distribution efficiency, and potential EMI issues.
- Suggests improvements for high-speed signal routing and differential pairs.

‚úÖ Manufacturability & Assembly Review
- Uses AI to detect potential fabrication issues (e.g., silkscreen misalignment, solder mask clearance).
- Ensures the design aligns with common PCB manufacturing constraints.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Generating a Report**
The application compiles the analysis results into a detailed report with:

- Issue Summaries & Severity Ratings
- Recommendations & Fixes
- Visual Annotations (where applicable)

5Ô∏è‚É£ **User Review & Iteration**
The user reviews the findings and applies necessary changes to their design in KiCad.
